SELECT * FROM TableA
INNER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.col_match = TableB.col_match

-- Imagine a Venn Diagram
-- Where one circle represents TableA.col_match 
-- The other represents TableB.col_match
-- The intersection / cross-over is the returned result
-- This is only true for a INNER JOIN

-- Example
-- Tracking logins for a virtual conference
-- TableA = Registartions - users who have registered for the conference 
-- TableB = Logins - user who have logged in to the conference
SELECT * FROM Registrations
INNER JOIn Lgins
ON Registrations.name = Login.name
-- The returned results are the names of users
-- who registered and logged in for the conference
-- INNER JOINs are looking for matches that exist in both tables

-- If you want to get rid of duplication you need to specify what results you want
SELECT reg_id, Logins.name,log_id
FROM Registartions
INNER JOIN Logins
ON Registartions.name = Logins.name
-- you have to specifiy fields that exist in both tables
-- Example name exists in both tables
-- This is solved by specifying Login.name over Registration.name

-- JOIN command defualts to INNER JOIN
