-- There are a few different types od OUTER JOINS

-- They will allow us to specify how to deal with values only present in one of the
-- tables being joined.

-- These are the more complex JOINs

-- FULL OUTER JOIN

SELECT * FROM TableA
FULL OUTER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.col_match = TableB.col_match

-- Video Conference example
SELECT * FROM Registrations
FULL OUTER JOIN Logins
ON Registartions.name = Logins.name

-- Clarifying WHERE null

SELECT * FROM TableA
FULL OUTER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.col_match = TableB.col_match
WHERE TableA.id IS null OR
TableB.id IS null

-- Video Conference example
SELECT * FROM Registrations 
FULL OUTER JOIN Logins
ON Registrations.name = Logins.name
WHERE Registartions.reg_id IS null OR
Logins.log_id IS null



-- dvdrental.tar
-- Making sure all customer data is matached to a purcahse histroy
SELECT * FROM customer
FULL OUTER JOIN payment
ON customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id
WHERE customer.customer_id IS null
OR payment.payment_id IS null
-- returns empty results
-- all customer data is matched to a purchase history
-- there are no unique rows to either table



-- LEFT OUTER JOIN
-- results in the set of records that are in the left table
-- if there is no match with the right table
-- the results are null

SELECT * FROM TableA
LEFT OUTER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.col_match = TableB.col_match




-- Clarifying WHERE null
